        <p>To most fans of Korean beauty, Pony has carved out success for herself with her almost encyclopedic knowledge of makeup and beauty products. With her youthful good looks, bright personality, a quick sense of humor, and an innate sense of style, Pony is an inspiration for many women. Prior to her YouTube career, Pony was an ‘ulzzang’ who often modeled for Korean e-commerce stores (‘online shopping malls’). Pony expertly executed and extremely chatty makeup tutorials attract her audience by showing them how to craft the perfect smoky eye to how to recreate K-pop idols’ glam. Since most of Pony’s videos are easy to follow along and have English subtitles, her videos draw numerous attention from her overseas fans</p>
